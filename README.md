# Source Cooperative 

A data publishing utility that allows trusted organizations and individuals to share data using standard HTTP methods.

## Project Status

Source Cooperative is operational and available at [https://source.coop](https://source.coop), providing access to over 800TB of data. 

A new version of the Source Cooperative web app called *S2* is under active development. It is currently only available to be deployed locally and is not yet available in staging or production environments.

### Development Stages
- **Current**: Local Development (v0.1.0 - v0.3.0)
- **Planned**: Staging Environment (v0.4.0)
- **Planned**: Production Release (v0.6.0)

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git
- AWS CLI (for local DynamoDB interaction)

### Local Development
1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start development server: `npm run dev`

### Database Setup
The application requires a DynamoDB instance for data storage. We've added several convenience scripts to manage the local DynamoDB:

```bash
# Start DynamoDB (will prompt for table initialization if needed)
npm run start-dynamodb

# Check if DynamoDB is running
npm run check-dynamodb

# Initialize DynamoDB tables and sample data
npm run init-local
```

When you run `npm run dev`, the system automatically:
1. Checks if DynamoDB is running
2. Starts DynamoDB if it's not running
3. Skips initialization if tables already exist

### Development Environment
- Local DynamoDB running on port 8000
- Local file storage in `./test-storage`
- Ory Kratos for authentication
- Environment variables in `.env.local`

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the patterns outlined in `CURSOR_RULES.md`
- Components use Radix UI for consistent theming
- Pages follow Next.js 13+ App Router conventions
- TypeScript is used throughout the project

### Available Scripts

```bash
# Development
npm run dev         # Start development server
# npm run build       # Build production bundle
# npm run start      # Start production server
npm run lint       # Run ESLint
npm run type-check # Run TypeScript checks
```

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **Build errors**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Clear `.next` directory and rebuild
   ```bash
   rm -rf .next
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Environment variables not working**
   - Verify `.env.local` exists and is properly configured
   - Restart the development server

3. **Type errors**
   - Run `npm run type-check` to identify issues
   - Ensure types are properly imported
